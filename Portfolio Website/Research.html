        In the 1st photo, we can see the portfolio website of Mr. Ryan. He has
        used div tag to create his website. Then, he has divided his website
        into two parts using two more div tags inside the main div tag. The
        has used the flex attribute to divide his website into two parts. In
        the left side Mr. Ryan has added a photo and few icons of social media
        platforms with the links to their respective websites. In the 2nd
        photo, you can see that I have used a background image with a text
        message in it. Like Mr. Ryan, I have used two div tags for my page.
        However, I didn’t use the flex attribute for my page. In one div tag,
        I have created my navigation bar whereas in the other one, I have
        inserted a picture. I used Mr. Ryan’s page as a reference for my
        homepage.
        </p>

      <!--Creating a section tag with image tag and paragraph tag inside it-->
      <section>
        <img class="img" src="Images/Research/Research9.png" alt="homepage" />
        <img class="img" src="Images/Research/Research2.png" alt="homepage" />
        <p>
        I used this page as a reference for my navigation bar. I created my
        navigation bar. In the 1st picture, the nav bar is created using a
        header tag. Inside the header tag, there are many other div tags.
        Using the div tag, the logo is added in the left side of the page
        while the navigation bar is used in the right side. For the navigation
        bar, unordered list tag is used. We can see that inside the list of
        navigation bar there is drop down style. To create the drop-down
        style, another unordered list tag has been used inside the list.
        However, I only used this website to create a navigation bar with no
        drop down style. </p>

        <img class="img" src="Images/Research/Research4.png" alt="My Contact" />
        <p>
        As you can see, I used this page as a reference to make my contact page.
        In the 1st photo, you can see the contact page of Bleed Design Studio.
        They have used various tags such as header tag, div tag and form tag to
        create their page. They have made a very simple looking webpage using very
        few tags compared to other websites I have seen. In the form tag, I have
        used input tag while Ms. Kimberly has used label tag. I have used flex
        attribute in my page to divide my page into two parts.

        <img class="img" src="Images/Research/Research5.png" alt="Blog" />
        <img class="img" src="Images/Research/Research6.png" alt="My Blog" />
        <p>
        For my blog, I looked at the blog of drafts website. In their website,
        they have used diverse group of tags such as h2 tag, h3 tag, paragraph tag,
        strong tag and others. They also used image tag to display image.
        First, they have used the h2 tag to create a title for the blog and then
        they have used the image tag to display an image. After that,
        they have used paragraph tag to write the blog. For my blog,
        I have used a similar style. I have used h1 tag to write the title
        of my blog and then used paragraph tag to write my blog. I have used
        a image slider to show display few images in my blog.

        <p>
        For my CV, I looked at the website of Mr. Andris Gauracs.
        I really like his website. The design was really cool. The
        overall layout of the webpage of the page was really cool.
        However, I only used as a reference for my CV. His CV had
        a lot of div tags used in it. There was many div tags inside
        another div tag. The unordered list tag was used as well.
        Inside the unordered list, div tags were used as well.
        I also used div tags and unordered tags however,
        I did the opposite of Mr. Andris. I used unordered tags inside
        the div tags. I also added a profile photo in my CV.
