          Everyone uses technologies these days. There have been so many great
          technological inventions. We are so immersed in technology that our
          life practically is being dependent on it. Same things apply to me as
          well. In my daily life, I use technology every hour of the day. One of
          the reasons is because I am an IT student. But, even so, I use
          technology too much of my own good. One could say that I am basically
          a technology addict. Using technology has its own advantages as well
          as disadvantages for a person. For me, I would have to say it is more
          advantageous.
          <br />
          I like to surf on the internet a lot. My day goes by scrolling down
          multiple social media. I surf on the internet for information. Itâ€™s
          amazing how by simply scrolling through my social media can give me so
          many information. I get to know what is happening all around the
          world. The co-vid situation of different countries. What my favorite
          people are going through during these tough times. I get to connect
          with so many people within few seconds. I find this very amusing. Its
          like the whole world is within my pocket. I get to learn many more
          things through technology. Apart from this, I get to watch my favorite
          shows, football matches and so on with ease. <br />
          I believe I am too much dependent in technology. Sometimes I find
          myself unconsciously looking at my phone for no reason. I tend to
          sleep very late at night. I lose my sense of time while surfing in the
          internet. I used to go out a lot with my friends when I was not so
          familiar with technology. But now, I would rather stay at my home and
          use my phone than to go out with my friends. I feel overwhelmed using
          technology. However, I am trying the not let the internet and
          technology control my life.
